# Project Solution: Detailed Requirements

## 1. Project Overview

The solution implements a smart contract-based system leveraging Ethereum blockchain, off-chain storage (IPFS), and a modern web backend/frontend stack. The system enables users to interact with smart contracts, store/retrieve data off-chain, and provides a user-friendly web interface.

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Smart Contract Layer

- Develop Solidity smart contracts for the core business logic (e.g., asset registration, trade, or comparison logic as per the project scope).
- Contracts must be deployable to a local Ethereum testnet (Ganache).
- Provide scripts for compiling, deploying, and interacting with contracts using Python (`web3.py`, `py-solc-x`).

### 2.2 Off-Chain Storage

- Integrate IPFS for storing large or non-critical data off-chain.
- Provide endpoints to upload and retrieve files/data from IPFS.
- Store IPFS hashes in the smart contract for data integrity and reference.

### 2.3 Backend API

- Use Python 3.18+ with Django-Ninja to build a RESTful API.
- Endpoints for:
  - User registration/authentication (if required).
  - Interacting with smart contracts (read/write operations).
  - Uploading/retrieving data from IPFS.
  - Querying contract and off-chain data.
- Use Celery and Redis for background tasks (e.g., periodic data sync, event listening).

### 2.4 Database

- Use PostgreSQL for persistent storage of user data, transaction logs, and metadata.
- Design schema to link on-chain data (contract addresses, transaction hashes) with off-chain and user data.

### 2.5 Frontend

- Use React (with Elastic UI) to build a modern, responsive web interface.
- Features:
  - Dashboard for users to view and interact with smart contracts.
  - Forms for submitting data to the blockchain/IPFS.
  - Real-time updates (using WebSockets or polling) for contract events.
  - Display of tradeoff/comparison results as per the projectâ€™s focus.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- Containerize all services using Docker and orchestrate with Docker Compose.
- Provide scripts/configuration for local development and deployment.
- Use pre-commit hooks and ruff for code quality.
- Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- Prepare for Kubernetes/Argo deployment (provide manifests or Helm charts if required).

---

## 4. Environment & Tooling

- Python 3.18+ (backend)
- Node.js 16+ (frontend)
- Docker, Docker Compose
- Ganache (Ethereum testnet)
- go-ipfs (IPFS node)
- PostgreSQL, Redis
- Celery (background tasks)
- Django-Ninja, web3.py, py-solc-x, ipfshttpclient, python-dotenv
- React, Elastic UI
- pre-commit, ruff, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, Argo

## 5. Deliverables

- Source code for smart contracts, backend, and frontend.
- Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml for all services.
- Database schema and migration scripts.
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger via Django-Ninja).
- User and developer documentation (README, setup guides).
- CI/CD configuration files.
- (Optional) Kubernetes/Argo deployment manifests.
