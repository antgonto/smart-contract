# Wallet Integration Requirements

## 1. Functional Requirements

### 1.1. Wallet Setup
- Support for Ethereum testnet (e.g., Sepolia).
- Ability to generate and manage public-private key pairs.
- Support importing existing accounts (e.g., via mnemonic).
- Basic UI/UX to view address and balance.

### 1.2. Transaction Signing
- Sign transactions for:
  - Certificate issuance (storing metadata/hash).
  - Revocation list updates.
  - Access control modifications.
- Sign arbitrary messages (e.g., for off-chain proof or authentication).
- Support ECDSA signature standard (Ethereum standard).

### 1.3. Smart Contract Interaction
- Interact with deployed contracts (read/write).
- Call functions like:
  - `issueCertificate(address user, bytes32 hash)`
  - `revokeCertificate(uint certId)`
  - `grantAccess(address requester)`
- Handle gas fee estimations and allow user confirmation.

### 1.4. Token/NFT Handling (If applicable)
- Manage certificate tokens (ERC-721 or ERC-1155).
- Show token metadata (e.g., diploma info).
- Support token transfer and ownership verification.

## üîê 2. Security Requirements

### 2.1. Private Key Management
- Secure key storage (e.g., MetaMask vault).
- Prevent exposure of private keys in front-end or logs.
- Use hardware wallet integration (optional for advanced users).

### 2.2. Authentication / Signature Verification
- Implement backend or smart contract validation for signed messages (e.g., `ecrecover`).
- Authenticate users using signed challenge-response for login (optional).

## üåê 3. Integration Requirements

### 3.1. Frontend Integration
- Use libraries like:
  - `web3.js` for smart contract and wallet integration.
  - `wagmi`, `rainbowkit`, or `web3modal` for user-friendly wallet connection.
- Implement "Connect Wallet" UI component.
- Show connected wallet address and status.

### 3.2. Backend Integration (if applicable)
- Verify wallet-based signatures for API access (token-auth alternatives).
- Link blockchain address to user records (if centralized off-chain features exist).

## üß™ 4. Testing and Deployment Requirements

### 4.1. Testing
- Use Ethereum testnets for deployment and wallet testing.
- Fund wallets with test ETH using faucets.
- Simulate certificate lifecycle: issue ‚Üí verify ‚Üí revoke.

### 4.2. Deployment
- Ensure wallet works with both on-chain and off-chain versions of the project.
- Include wallet connection and usage steps in user documentation.
- Provide fallback or notification if wallet is not installed or connected.

## üìÑ 5. Documentation Requirements

- User guide for:
  - Installing MetaMask (or preferred wallet).
  - Connecting the wallet to the dApp.
  - Approving transactions.

- Developer instructions for:
  - Integrating wallet libraries.
  - Handling wallet events (connect, disconnect, network change).
  - Smart contract interaction via wallet.

## üß© Optional Enhancements

- Support for multiple wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet).
- Session-based login using signed messages (non-custodial auth).
